# Stockinette Knitout Generator

Generate knitout by navigating to this directory and running
`python knitout_generator.py`.This file contains an `if __name__ = "__main__"`
statement which calls the stockinette knitout function. Currently, it is called
with a random number of rows and columns between 10 and 20. For a specific
swatch size, edit the function call. I've also included a backup knitout file
with instructions for a swatch of size 16x16, which is in `swatch16.k`.
